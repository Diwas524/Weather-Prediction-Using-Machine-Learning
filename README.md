# Weather-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
In this research paper, we explore the application of ML to weather prediction. Specifically, we focus on the use of supervised learning algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors, to predict weather conditions based on historical data. We use a dataset containing daily weather measurements
